When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other tech specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? Lastly, how much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost in the UK?

Apple's last iMac update came back in October 2015, when it introduced a Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipped the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options.



It's been a while, then, which is why we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - an early-2017 iMac update, hopefully. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print.

When will new iMacs be launched in the UK?
When will new iMacs come out? Next month (April 2017), we hope, but nothing official has been announced yet. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's spring 2017 event.)

Aside from September's regular iPhone launches, spring (and usually March) is the time Apple normally holds a press conference to announce a new product. The iPhone SE and 9.7in iPad Pro were announced on 21 March 2016. Fingers crossed April will bring an event with new iMacs.

Apple did update a number of its products in March 2017, quietly updating its online store with a new 9.7-inch iPad (called simply "iPad"), adding a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and increasing the storage options for the iPad mini 4 and iPhone SE. But no new Macs were announced, and we're holding out hope that they will appear at a rather more high-profile event in April.
